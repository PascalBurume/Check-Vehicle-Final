## How to have the same database?
In easy way like for our Prototype it is to use SharePoint list, then you'll upload an Excel list.
Go to the SharePoint website where the list is located.

  - Click on the "Lists" or "Apps" link on the top navigation bar, then find and click on the link for the list where you want to upload the Excel file.

  - On the list page, click on the "Files" tab in the top ribbon, then click on the "New Document" button.

  - In the "New Document" menu, select "Excel" to create a new Excel file in the list `(The file demos it is on the folder Prototype )`for example.
  
  
  - If you want to upload an existing Excel file, click on the "Upload Document" button, then select the file from your computer by clicking on the "Browse" button.`(The file demos it is on the folder Prototype )`

  - You can open the file by clicking on its name, and you will be able to view, edit and share the document with others.

Note: Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to upload files to the SharePoint list. Also, if the option to upload files is not available in the list, you may need to contact your SharePoint administrator to have the necessary permissions enabled.
